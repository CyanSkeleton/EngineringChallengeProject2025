# Reminder App
Note: I forgot to commit my most recent changes so the current files are a bit outdated and have some issues, I will commit the updated version and add a release once I get home. If you want to see it, watch this repo (the button next to "fork" and "star").
## Setup
### Main Setup
1. Download the zip file in Releases
2. Unzip the zip file in your download folder
3. Move the contents of the zip file wherever you want but **keep ReminderAppDeadlines.json and ReminderAppSettings.json in the same folder as ReminderApp.exe**
### Setting up the email system
1. Create or log into a Google account
2. Enable 2FA (two factor authentication)
3. [Go to Create and manage your app passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
4. Create an app password (App name doesn't matter)
5. Enter in the app password and the email tied to it into the settings panel
